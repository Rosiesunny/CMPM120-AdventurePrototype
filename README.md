A simple adventure game by {who?} based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Code requirements:
- **4+ scenes based on `AdventureScene`**: unsatisfied (name at least 4 of the classes).
- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: introscene1, introscene2, introscene3, introscene4
- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - Enhancement 1: Moving scene objects into sceneData.json and using a function to load them. Heavily referenced Poom's work @ https://github.com/sirapatp257/CMPM120-Demo2 for this because I couldn't get it working on my own, sadface. 
    - Enhancement 2: unsatisfied (name the method and explain the use of it).

Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: pathStart, pathBerry, pathBike, pathStream, pathCabin
- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**: Arrows in start scene, berries in berry scene, WIP in others.
- **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: Arrows in start scene, berries in berry scene, WIP in others.
- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: Arrows in start scene
- **Some objects are themselves animated**: Arrows in start scene, berries in berry scene? I don't know if fading counts but the arrows move.

Asset sources:
- (For each image/audio/video asset used, describe how it was created. What tool did you use to create it? Was it based on another work? If so, how did you change it, and where can we learn more about the original work for comparison? Use [Markdown link syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links).)

Code sources:
- `adventure.js` and `index.html` were created for this project [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly) and edited by me.
- `game.js` was sketched by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly) and rewritten by me.
